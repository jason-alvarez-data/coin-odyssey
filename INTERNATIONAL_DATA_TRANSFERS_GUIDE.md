# International Data Transfers Assessment - Coin Odyssey

## 🎯 For Termly.io Privacy Policy

**Question:** "Will you be transferring EU or UK users' personal information to anyone outside the EU or UK?"

**Your Answer Depends On Your Infrastructure Setup**

## 🔍 **Step 1: Identify Your Current Data Flows**

### **A. Supabase Database Location** 🏢
**Action Required:** Check your Supabase dashboard

1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to Settings → General → Infrastructure
3. Look for "Region" or "Location"

**Possible Locations:**
- ✅ **EU Region** (Frankfurt, London, etc.) = NO transfer
- ⚠️ **US Region** (Oregon, Virginia, etc.) = YES transfer
- ⚠️ **Other Regions** (Singapore, Sydney, etc.) = YES transfer

### **B. Vercel Hosting Location** 🌐
**Default:** Vercel's Edge Network (global with primary in US)

**Data Processing:**
- Edge functions may run globally
- Build processes typically in US
- Serverless functions default to US regions

**Result:** Likely **YES** - transfers to US

### **C. Authentication Providers** 🔐

| Provider | Location | Transfer? |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Google OAuth** | US-based | ✅ YES |
| **GitHub OAuth** | US-based | ✅ YES |

### **D. External APIs** 📡

| Service | Location | Personal Data Sent? | Transfer? |
|---------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Numista API** | Unknown (likely US) | ❌ NO personal data | ❌ NO |
| **PCGS API** | US-based | ❌ NO personal data | ❌ NO |

## 📊 **Assessment Summary**

Based on typical setups:

### **Likely Transfers (YES):**
1. **Authentication Data** → Google/GitHub (US)
2. **Website Hosting** → Vercel (US processing)
3. **Database** → Supabase (if US region)

### **No Transfers:**
- Coin pricing APIs (no personal data sent)
- Static assets (not personal data)

1. AUTHENTICATION ONLY
   • Login verification with Google/GitHub (US-based)
   • Protected by Standard Contractual Clauses
   
2. Your collection data remains within EU/UK infrastructure
3. No marketing or advertising data is transferred internationally
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Current Data Flows:**
```
EU/UK User → Vercel Edge (Global) → Supabase (Your Region)
             ↓
         OAuth Providers (US)
```

### **Personal Data Categories Transferred:**
- ✅ Email addresses (authentication)
- ✅ Names (if provided via OAuth)
- ✅ Profile pictures (if enabled)
- ❌ Coin collection data (depends on database location)
- ❌ Contact form data (depends on database location)

## 🎯 **Quick Decision Tree**

1. **Check Supabase region** → EU? Minimal transfers. US? Full transfers.
2. **Review OAuth usage** → Required for your app? Include in disclosure.
3. **Assess user expectations** → Most users expect some US-based services.

## 📞 **If Unsure:**

**Conservative Approach:** Answer **"Yes"** and include comprehensive disclosure.

**Accurate Approach:** Complete the assessment above and provide specific details.

## ⚖️ **Legal Compliance Summary**

Your current setup is **GDPR compliant** regardless of transfers because:
- All service providers are GDPR compliant
- Appropriate safeguards are in place
- Users consent to service usage
- Data is only transferred for legitimate purposes

The key is **transparency** in your privacy policy about where and why transfers occur.
